These three housemates were Dylan Yturralde, Noimie Steikunas, and Therese Villamor.<br /><br />Dylan was among of the nominated housemates that have been done so automatically - this has came as a result of the decision of the housemates to automatically nominate him due to failing their first weekly task of filling up a large container with water from the pool by using household items within 11 minutes and 59 seconds. Aside from Dylan, Therese Villamor received 13 nomination points while Noimie Steikunas had 12 points.<br /><br />Others, like Jas Dudley-Scales that had 5 points, JM Ibarra and Kanata Tapia with 4 points each, Brx Ruiz, Dingdong Bahan and Patrick Ramirez (the duo of DongPat), Kai Montinola, and Kolette Madelo with 1 point each, Binsoy Namoca, Jarren Garcia, Marc Nanninga, and Rain Celmar that had no points, are not nominated in here, according to the show's 1st nomination tally.<br /><br />PHCA CID: PHCA-2025H2-2421&#8203;&#8203;</div>

At yan sina JM Ibarra at Fyang Smith!<br /><br />The final evictee and the Big Winner of Pinoy Big Brother: Gen 11. And now, they are both ghosted all thanks to their recently-dropped digiseries on iWant - Ghosting, starring JM Ibarra, the Poginsyanong Pilo-To-Be of Quezon (as Wilberto), and Fyang Smith, the Anakabogerang Influencer of Mandaluyong (as Jaja). JM entered the house on the show's premiere, with Fyang followed suit a day after Therese Villamor's eviction, along with Jan Silva.<br /><br />Fyang was the most followed PBB Gen 11 housemate on TikTok (as her moniker implies), during and after her stay inside the house, which resulted to her declaration of Big Winner at the October 26, 2024's The Final Stage at the Big Night, after a number of times being nominated and being part of the Big 4.<br /><br />"I can't believe this! I want to thank every one of you, who has supported me since day one. I did it!" That was what Fyang had exclaimed at the Big Night, all thanks to the 30.66% BBS Votes on the Maya app - the 18th Big Winner of Pinoy Big Brother since it's launch in 2005 (the successor was Brent Manalo and Mika Salamanca, the 19th and 20th in PBB, through PBB Collab, that held it's Big Night last July 5, 2025). JM Ibarra was declared the final evictee of PBB Gen 11 a week prior to the Big Night, citing that he was voted by 17.32% of the public vote.<br /><br />JM and Fyang were widely known for their highly anticipated offerings after their PBB stint, through music videos (i.e. Wherever You Are and Crazy For You by Regine Velasquez-Alcasid), films (i.e. My Love Will Make You Disappear, Filipino-dubbed Picnic, Child no. 82, and Shake, Rattle, and Roll: The Evil Origins), TV/Online Shows and Series (ASAP every Sunday noontime, and Ghosting), and soundtracks, like Tayo Hanggang Dulo, the OST for Ghosting, and a part of Fyang's Debut EP, Forever FYANG.<br /><br />PHCA CID: PHCA-2025H2-1952</div>

And this is what you've just seen here in their yesterday's Advanced SCREAMing night for Ghosting, in line of the series premiere.<br /><br />But before we dive in to the beginning of this digiseries of WilJa, mga Multo hanggang Dulo, that gained over 40 Million Views across all of the teasers and trailers of Ghosting posted on iWant's official social media accounts, and also speaking of Fyang Smith, Star Magic, the talent agency of the Anakabogerang Influencer na Big Winner of PBB Gen 11, had recently issued a statement involving the issues of fake photos and videos of her (including those that are AI-generated).<br /><br />In it's statement, Star Magic came in to their attention that "maliciously edited videos and images of our talent, Fyang Smith, have been circulating online. Star Magic condemns the act of illegally manipulating videos and/or photos of celebrities or anyone, moreso when intended mainly to damage a person's name, image, and reputation."<br /><br />"We would like to appeal to everyone to stop sharing or engaging with these fake photos and videos on social media. The welfare of our talents is our top priority, and we intend to persue legal action against the perpetrators and anyone who posts, distributes, or duplicates these videos and images," Star Magic added.<br /><br />Earlier, we, as well as Team JMFyang Official, had issued a statement involving the case of spliced videos of Fyang's speech during the April 5, 2025's Gen 11 FanCon at the SM North EDSA Skydome. DRPS PHCA is encouraged to protect JM and Fyang at all times, without any form of fake and misleading information circulated online.<br /><br />PHCA CID: PHCA-2025H2-1933</div>

That was the Singing Gwapa and the Charming Crooner, Kai Montinola and Jarren Garcia, both we're announced as the fourth and the fifth of the first five official housemates of Pinoy Big Brother: Gen 11, as announced in the last year's Star Hunt Audition Show, in the end of July 18 and 19, 2024 episodes.<br /><br />And in the beginning of the New Gen Teleserye ng Totoong Buhay in July 20, 2024, they were now inside the house! Jarren was the only PBB Gen 11 housemate who haven't received any nomination points since the first nomination night, until when he received two points in the 7th nomination night, but not nominated. When he was evicted in the 9th eviction night (citing that he received 5 points from the nomination part), he was part of the House Challengers of PBB Gen 11, along with Jas, DongPat, and Therese.<br /><br />Kai Montinola was the 4th Big Placer of PBB Gen 11, voted by 17.38% of people on the Maya app. And after the time when Kai ended her journey with big winnings, she was seen in the finale episode of Saving Grace as a cameo role character of teenage Grace Banaag, and later seen in an episode of Maalaala Mo Kaya, with Kyle Echarri.<br /><br />Jarren led his own fan meet event of "That Boy, JARREN!" held at the SM North EDSA Skydome last February 8, 2025 for his self-titled album. Kai also did a similar fan meet event last June 28, 2025 at the same venue as before (including those from Kolette and Rain), under the title of "Kai's The Limit", for her album launching of Kaileidoscope. Her debut EP also include "Shooting Star", sung by Kai and Jarren themselves.<br /><br />As of July 18, 2025 at 22h20, Jarren's own self-titled EP now had over 2,290,067 streams on Spotify, while Kai's Kaileidoscope EP was listened by 1,167,230 times on the same platform.<br /><br />PHCA CID: PHCA-2025H2-1917</div>

Kinuha niya ako bilang choreographer at makatulong po ito para mapagpatuloy ang aking pagaaral. Pero mabigat man ang pinagdaanan, nananatili ako masiyahin, positive lang sa buhay." - Binsoy Namoca, July 20, 2024, PBB Gen 11 Premiere<br /><br />"Bilang bata, aminado akong pasaway ako noon, sa bahay, sa school, love life, at sa buhay. Pero after a motorcycle accident, binago ko lahat para makabawi sa aking pamilya at sa aking sarili. Sa pagpasok sa Bahay ni Kuya, hindi ko sasayangin ang aking pangalawang chance para maabot ang aking pangarap." - Jan Silva, August 4, 2024, PBB Gen 11<br /><br />A choreographer turned into a reality through acting, and this is what Binsoy Namoca had did, when he was named as the third of the five announced housemates at the end of the Star Hunt Audition Show, and have been entered inside the Big Brother House for PBB Gen 11 at the beginning of that edition.<br /><br />And this is what he persued after this exit inside the house through the 10th eviction night - as the Maabilidancing Dong of South Cotabato is playing the role of Rey Vargas in Love At First Spike, streaming exclusively on iWant subscribers, with new episodes every Friday at 20h00.<br /><br />And in recent news, he will be seen in an upcoming episode of Maalaala Mo Kaya, involving the life story of Eugene dela Cruz, to be televised on-air on Kapamilya Channel, A2Z, and ALLTV2 this Saturday, July 19, 2025 (while it is been available as well on iWant, as an advanced episode, 72-hours prior to airing).<br /><br />Jan Silva, the Prodigal Bai of Cebu, entered the house a day after Therese's eviction, along with Fyang Smith. He was evicted inside the house in the 5th eviction night. And in the outside world, he, along with the other PBB Gen 11 ex-HMs, Rain Celmar and Joli Alferez, was seen in a music video of Divine, sung by BGYO, back in March 13, 2025.<br /><br />PHCA CID: PHCA-2025H2-1827</div>

Kilalanin natin siya, pati na rin si JP Cabrera.<br /><br />"Growing up, nasanay ako sa maraming rules from my own good. Strict si mommy as a single parent. But then, I broke the rules at tuluyang nawalan sa focus sa studies. And this time, focus na ako sa pangarap ko. I'm ready to follow and fight for my dreams sa Bahay ni Kuya." - Therese Villamor, July 20, 2024, PBB Gen 11 Premiere<br /><br />"Lumaki ng kumportableng buhay dahil sa daddy kong businessman. Pero nang inambush siya noon, nagbago nang lahat. Sa pagpasok ko sa Bahay ni Kuya, bitbit ko ang karahasang ito, para lalong tumibay." - JP Cabrera, August 12, 2024 PBB Gen 11 episode<br /><br />Did you hear that what the ex-Housemates of Pinoy Big Brother: Gen 11 had said on the premiere day and on the August 12, 2025 episodes of it? Let's talk about Therese Villamor, the Determined Daughter of Camarines Sur, and JP Cabrera, the Persevering Bunso of Quezon City.<br /><br />Therese was the first PBB Gen 11 housemate to announce in the first of the five episodes of Star Hunt Audition Show, that premiered a year ago on ABS-CBN Channels, known as the Determined Daughter of Camarines Sur. She was surrounded with bad influence prior to her entry inside the house, until she grown her up with gratefulness.<br /><br />Unfortunately, citing that she was among of the nominees in the 1st Nomination Night of PBB Gen 11 (alongside Dylan and Noimie), she was named as the first evictee of that edition, as they have been voted to save her inside the house from eviction by a net votes of 16.22% (BBS 19.49% - BBE 3.27%).<br /><br />For JP, he entered inside the house a day after Kanata and Marc's eviction (along with Joli). His entry was televised in the August 12, 2024 episode, while he was known as an NGSB (No Girlfriend Since Birth) in here. He was evicted from the Big Brother the house in the 11th eviction night, citing that he was voted by 9.61% of BBS Votes.<br /><br />PHCA CID: PHCA-2025H2-1782</div>

Kilalanin natin sina Jas Dudley-Scales at Dylan Yturralde.<br /><br />"Gaya ng volleyball game, minsan panalo, gaya ng mga pagkakataon na narecruit ako para makapaglaro sa UAAP. Kaya ang volleyball game, minsan, talo. At gaya ng volleyball game, all in na'kong lalaban at magpapakatotoo sa loob ng Bahay ni Kuya." - Dylan Yturralde, July 20, 2024, PBB Gen 11 Premiere<br /><br />"But despite all these challenges that life through at me, I chose to face them with courage and possibility. Kaya naman, handa na akong pumasok sa Bahay ni Kuya, at ipakita ko na kahit anong challenges yan, kayang-kaya kong lagpasan." - Jas Dudley-Scales, July 20, 2024, PBB Gen 11 Premiere<br /><br />Remember JasDy loveteam pair during the time when Pinoy Big Brother: Gen 11 was broadcast on ABS-CBN Platforms? If yes, let's talk about Dylan Yturralde, the Astig Volleybae of Pampanga, and Jas Dudley-Scales, the Optimistic Ate of Dumaguete.<br /><br />Before their entry inside the house, Dylan was widely known as a UAAP men's volleyball player of UE Red Warriors, while Jas was known as an accounting manager of Mega Magazine, one of a well-known magazines of the Philippines published by One Mega Group (as previously mentioned in our past post last September 18, 2024, involving the issue of Jas and Fyang and their rap battle, a few days before it).<br /><br />For Dylan, on July 21, 2024, a day after PBB Gen 11's premiere, he was appeared in an episode of Regal Studio Presents (aired on GMA), under the title of "Happy Libing", playing the role of "Raphael". On the seventh eviction night, he was evicted inside the house, receiving the lowest net total votes of 11.05% (BBS 16.43% - BBE 5.38%).<br /><br />For Jas, on the following week (8EN) however, was also evicted from the house as well, for receiving a low BBS Vote of 23.44%. This is the first BBS-only voting in PBB Gen 11 was happened, citing that the 8th eviction period votings on the Maya app had removed the option to BBE caused by online bashing.<br /><br />PHCA CID: PHCA-2025H2-1737</div>

Then your answer is the Lazada App if you are shopping whenever you are, especially when an online seller is offering something through live streaming, on LazLive, and when you're ready to check out, you can use your Maya wallet, card, or credit.<br /><br />But, did you know that these two apps are used during the airtime of Pinoy Big Brother: Gen 11? If yes, then the New Gen Housemates of Big Brother are being seen online, when you go to the Lazada app, and look for the PBB Banner, for you to be able to watch the inside-the-house live streaming (Main, Dining, Living, and Pool) through LazLive, from 8h00 to 0h00 (PHT UTC+8) daily. They can also check out for deals and more, even when the housemates are doing some live selling during 8.8, 9.9, and 10.10 sales.<br /><br />And when every nomination nights of PBB Gen 11, as happened weekly, the names of the housemates who have been up for eviction, is to have the power to vote using the Maya app, the reality show's current exclusive voting partner since then, and later used on PBB Collab, the edition's successor. They, Maya Wallet holders, can have the power to Save or Evict for as low as P10 for 10 votes, as well as P50 for 50 votes, and P100 for 110 votes when they open the app, cashed-in their Maya wallets, and accessing the PBB Voting Page by tapping on the "PBB" icon.<br /><br />The option to BBE a nominated housemate was available until when PBB had announced in the September 14, 2025 episode, wherein that option was taken away in favor of BBS-only voting for the 8th and succeeding eviction voting periods, including for the nomination of Big 4 Housemates, and the voting for a Big Winner at the Big Night. This removal was made as a decision due to the issues of social media bashing against it's current and former housemates of PBB Gen 11 during the time being.<br /><br />PHCA CID: PHCA-2025H2-1682</div>

The first one was DongPat, Dingdong Bahan and Patrick Ramirez, and the other one was JoliGwen, Joli Alferez and Gwen Montano.<br /><br />Dingdong, the Charismatic Partner of Patrick, prior to the time he persued as a housemate of PBB, was a political affairs officer and engineer. He is also a former public servant as the Sangguniang Kabataan Chairmain of Lower Bicutan, Taguig City. Patrick, the Go-Getter Partner of Dingdong, was known as a content creator, athlete, model, and the owner of TigerWinx, his own restaurant, as an entrepreneur. 2024 was the year when Patrick was the proud partner in life in love of Dingdong. Their journey inside the house started on Day 1 until they were both evicted on the 4th Eviction Night.<br /><br />For JoliGwen, their journey begins when the Smiling Darling of Camarines Sur, Joli Alferez, a dentistry graduate, enters inside the house (along with JP Cabrera), a day after Kanata Tapia and Marc Nanninga's eviction, while Gwen Montano, the Brave Bromantiko of Cavite, and also a dentistry graduate, begins his journey on the August 21, 2024 episode. They have relations with Joli and Gwen, that later resulted of being a duo housemate on the following episode after. They were both evicted on the 6th Eviction Night.<br /><br />PHCA CID: PHCA-2025H2-1627</div>
