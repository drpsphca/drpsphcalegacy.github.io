The series was led by Anne Curtis, Joshua Garcia, and Carlo Aquino as it takes viewers on an emotional journey of pain, love, and healing in the Philippine adaptation of the critically acclaimed Korean drama that premiered not only through on-air, but also on Netflix 72 hours prior to airing and iWant 48 hours beforehand.&nbsp;<br /><br />It's stellar cast are Rio Locsin, Bobot Mortiz, Michael De Mesa, Maricel Laxa, Agot Isidro, Enchong Dee, Kaori Oinuma, Bodjie Pascua, Ana Abad Santos, Sharmaine Suarez, Xyriel Manabat, Louise Abuel, Francis Magundayao, Alora Sasam, Alyssa Muhlach, Bianca De Vera, Aljon Mendoza, and Mark Oblea, with Mae Cruz-Alviar and Raymond Ocampo were the director of this series, and it is produced under Star Creatives.<br /><br />In an ABS-CBN Press Release involving the series posted last July 5, 2025, it follows an emotionally guarded psychiatric ward caregiver Patpat (Joshua) who has dedicated his life to caring for his older brother Matmat (Carlo), a person with autism.<br /><br />Their world changes when they cross paths with a successful yet troubled children&rsquo;s book author Mia (Anne), who is known for her cold and eccentric personality. As Mia, Patpat, Matmat confront painful childhood traumas and emotional scars, they begin a journey of healing, self-acceptance, and love.<br /><br />Reimagined through a uniquely Filipino lens, the series promises a deeply emotional narrative that explores trauma, healing, and the power of love in the face of psychological struggles.<br /><br />When the series was premiered on Netflix (releasing its episodes 72 hours before airing), it took over in the first spot among all of the TV Shows on Netflix Philippines&rsquo; Top 10 TV Shows listing, while it also ranked second among all of the top 10 shows on the other online streaming platform from where the series is available, iWant (releasing them 48 hours in advance), as of July 25, 2025.<br /><br />Then the July 21, 2025 on-air premiere came in to Kapamilya Channel, A2Z, TV5, and Jeepney TV, when we, DRPS PHCA, made a TV Ad Listings between It&rsquo;s Okay To Not Be Okay, against its competitor, Sanggang Dikit, For Real, on GMA (under same timeslot basis). Based on our TV Ad Listings between the two shows, the series led by Anne, Joshua, and Carlo had aired a total of 70 TV Ads among all of the three commercial gaps on Kapamilya Channel, with 64 of them are from A2Z simulcast, and 65 on TV5 simulcast and Jeepney TV delayed airing. This is comparable with Sanggang Dikit For Real&rsquo;s 10 TV Ads on GMA &ndash; which is seven times higher based on our same timeslot final count of 22-24-24 (Kapamilya Channel) vs. 4-3-3 (GMA).<br /><br />Turning to the peak concurrent viewers (via ABS-CBN Entertainment YouTube Channel) and it&rsquo;s TV Ratings (via Nielsen NUTAM Preliminary/Overnight Report, also same timeslot), It&rsquo;s Okay To Not Be Okay was seen by about 608,595 of Kapamilyas online, and it&rsquo;s been voted by about 7.5% of viewers (c. Kapamilya Channel, A2Z, and TV5), compared to SDFR&rsquo;s 7.3% on GMA (with an additional 1.2% if aired on GTV as a delayed telecast, combining it will have a rating of 8.5%).<br /><br />However, on the following day, July 22, 2025, in terms of TV Ratings from Nielsen NUTAM Report, Sanggang Dikit For Real leads it&rsquo;s same timeslot rating on GMA of 7.3% (+1.2% with GTV Delayed Airing, totalling to 8.5%) - 1.0% less from It&rsquo;s Okay To Not Be Okay, despite it was viewed by about 644,942 of Kapamilyas concurrently online, and aired about 79 TV Ads (24-27-28) vs. SDFR&rsquo;s 9 TV Ads (3-3-3).<br /><br />The peak concurrent viewership of It&rsquo;s Okay To Not Be Okay, continues to post its all-time high numbers by a bit of 645,610 Kapamilyas (as of the time when Star Creatives posted the latest update involving the concurrent viewers of the series, July 23, 2025) and had aired about 69 TV Ads (on Kapamilya Channel), although the same timeslot ratings remains lost to Sanggang Dikit For Real on GMA, that aired 11 TV Ads during the commercial breaks, because it&rsquo;s been voted by 6.8% (+1.5% on GTV, equivalent to 8.3%) vs. 6.0%.<br /><br />At the moment, on the yesterday&rsquo;s episodes of It&rsquo;s Okay To Not Be Okay and Sanggang Dikit For Real (July 25, 2025), it aired about 10 TV Commercials on GMA during SDFR, while IOTNBO aired about 61 TV Ads on Kapamilya Channel, with 56 TV Ads on A2Z, and 57 TV Ads on TV5 and Jeepney TV.<br />&#8203;<br />For the curiousity on how we count the commercials of It's Okay To Not Be Okay on multiple channels, we based the commercial breaks during the broadcast, through Kapamilya Channel (including Jeepney TV&rsquo;s delayed airing) on iWant, and A2Z and TV5 for their Free to Air Broadcast. It aired the same sequence of TV Ads as from those on Kapamilya Channel, A2Z, TV5, and Jeepney TV for the first approx. 17 to 28 TV ads (based on all of the countings we&rsquo;ve made within the period of July 21 to 25, 2025), but some of those are exclusively aired on Kapamilya Channel for the last number of ads, while TV5 and Jeepney TV aired an online gambling ad (in some cases) as the final TV ad of each gap (A2Z did not aired its gambling ads in some case, leading to the continuation of the programming). For Sanggang Dikit For Real, the competitor to IOTNBO, it is based on GMA, citing that this is on a same timeslot data.</div>  <h2 class="wsite-content-title">Sports: Shooting Stars, wins the All Star Games 2025's Basketball Rematch vs. Anbilibabols</h2>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/1/4/5/7/145735993/phcafreeblog-starmagicasg2025results-20250721_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph">&#8203;For the second time around, the Cong TV's Anbilibabol Basketball Team remains lost against the opponent against Star Magic Shooting Stars, as seen in the yesterday's All Star Games 2025, organized by ABS-CBN Studios and held at the Smart Araneta Coliseum, with a final score of 70-73 (ANBI-STARS).<br /><br />It seems that Cong TV will even plan for their third basketball rematch if Star Magic All Star Games 2026 is coming around by next year, right?

Thus this is the beginning of the 11th season of the Philippine Version of the Big Brother Franchise (owned by Banijay), Pinoy Big Brother Gen 11, with a new batch of housemates, the tasks to begin with, the stories that the housemates could bring to our viewers, and the true voices of Big Brother and his family - as hosted by Kim Chiu, Robi Domingo, Enchong Dee, Bianca-Gonzalez-Intal, Melai Cantiveros Francisco, and the newest addition of the family during the time being, Alexa Ilacad.<br /><br />Before the beginning of Pinoy Big Brother: Gen 11, ABS-CBN had aired their Star Hunt Audition Show, which reveals the first five housemates to enter inside the house ahead of the show's premiere. Among all of the 35,906 entrants who have been auditioned for PBB Gen 11, through on-ground and online auditions, twenty of which have been selected to take inside the Big Brother's House, and the first five ones as announced at the end the Star Hutn Audition Show (aired from July 15 to 19, 2024), were Therese Villamor, The Determined Daughter of Camarines Sur, Dylan Yturralde, the Astig Volleybae of Pampanga, Binsoy Namoca, the Maabilidancing Dong of South Cotabato, Kai Montinola, the Singing Gwapa of Cebu, and Jarren Garcia, the Charming Crooner of London. And after all of these first five ones, at the time of the July 20 premiere, ten more of which have also entered inside, aside from the first five ones.<br /><br />And this is what the ten more housemates comes in - Marc Nanninga, the Sporty Go Lucky Kuya of Camarines Norte, Rain Celmar, the Cheerfu-Langga of Cebu, Kanata Tapia, the Lola-Ving Apo of Occidental Mindoro, Kolette Madelo, the Ma-Cute-Lit na Raketera of General Santos, JM Ibarra, the Poginsyanong Pilo-To Be of Quezon, Jas Dudley-Scales, the Optimistic Ate of Dumaguete, Noimie Steikunas, the Mombitious Chikadora of Lithuania, Brx Ruiz, the Seamanluluto of Bacolod, and the "two-in-one" housemates (more specifically known as Duo Housemates) that have been well-known in the LGBTQIA+ community, Dingdong Bahan and Patrick Ramirez, otherwise known as DongPat for short, monikered respectively as the Charismatic Partner of Taguig and the Go-Getter Partner of Maynila.<br /><br />In the first day of Pinoy Big Brother: Gen 11, as these first fifteen housemates have entered inside the house, they are about to embark on Kuya's latest series of tasks that will challenge their character and camaraderie within 100 days. But following to this, these fifteen housemates are immediately put to the test as Kuya announced that they are staying in as house guests and only 11 will remain to be hailed as the official housemates of the edition.<br /><br />Pinoy Big Brother: Gen 11 was widely known for their brand partnerships that stood it's popularity within the airing of the show until the Big Night. Cream Silk and Pond's, one of the personal care brands of Unilever Philippines was their partner for on-ground and online auditions, while Maya and Lazada are the two mobile applications that put the New Gen Teleserye ng Totoong Buhay for our viewers - through live streaming (and even selling that what the housemates did during the 8.8, 9.9, and 10.10 sales) via LazLive, and through the use of voting a nominated housemate with the Maya app, wherein the housemates will have to Save or Spend the money they've earned from each successful tasks with Maya Savings.<br /><br />The show was also widely known for the lines, words, and their songs that the housemates had composed, most notably, "C U Happy" (wherein within the period of the 3rdd Weekly Task period, it drawn over 189,786 of positive reactions across all Pinoy Big Brother social media pages), Tocino, Manok, and many more. The big beginnings starts with the "first eleven housemates will be named as official" until all of which that the fifteen hopefuls are declared later as official housemates, as what Big Brother said. But on July 28, 2024, the first nomination night was happened, and this is why Therese with 13 points, Noimie, with 12 points, and Dylan who was automatically nominated from the weekly task failures, are at risk of being evicted inside the house.<br /><br />Dylan Yturralde was automatically nominated in the 1st Nomination Night when a decision of the housemates to automatically nominate him following to their first weekly task failure, involving the filling up a large container with water from the pool by using household items within 11 minutes and 59 seconds. Within the week when Typhoon Carina and heavy monsoon rains was happened, the Big Brother house gets flooded, and for this, they held on together and dedicated a song to those affected by the said calamity.<br /><br />On August 3, 2024, Therese Villamor says goodbye to the housemates as she was the first-ever evicted housemate of Pinoy Big Brother Gen 11. This has came as a result of garnering the least combined save and evict votes with 16.22%, with Dylan Yturralde (40.06%) and Noime Steikunas (22.57%) continued their stay for a week longer, but for Dylan, he was nominated again on the following day, through the 2nd nomination night. As Therese bids goodbye from the Big Brother house, she shared her joy in becoming a housemate and the lessons she learned during her stay, especially in opening up to others.<br /><br />While Dylan was saved in the 1st Eviction Night, but later nominated in the 2nd Nomination part, and apart from him, Marc Nanninga, Kolette Madelo, Kanata Tapia, and DongPat are also part of the Big Brother's nomination list, in which six of them (in population) will put into danger that any two of them will get evicted from the house. This is also the day when two more housemates have entered inside the house - Jan Silva, the Prodigal Bai of Cebu, and Fyang Smith, the Anakabogerang Influencer of Mandaluyong. These two newly entered housemates will not be nominated for the third nomination round, while the housemates continued their momentum following their first weekly task triumph, thanks in part to the co-parenting teamwork of Brx, Binsoy, Jas, and Noimie in their 2nd Weekly Task, under the title of "Pinoy Big Babies".<br /><br />Gen Z housemates, Kanata Tapia and Marc Nanninga, on the second eviction night, made a goodbye bid in August 10, 2024. Kanata was voted by 11.61% combined votes, while Marc was voted by 5.09%. For the side note, Kanata Tapia and Marc Nanninga are both the youngest among all of the female and male housemates of Pinoy Big Brother: Gen 11. Kanata was born on January 12, 2008, while Marc was born on October 22, 2006. In the outside world, the Lola-Ving Apo, in February 2025, was seen in a music video of "Ako Na Sana", as sung by Jeri Violago and published on Tarsier Records YouTube Channel. Did you know that Jeri wrote this track for expressing his hopes of winning over the person he loves? Aside from Kanata, Jae Miranda, Erika Davis, and Julia Santiago were also seen in the music video.<br /><br />And upon the eviction of Kanata and Marc, the following day, JP Cabrera, the Persevering Bunso of Quezon City, and Joli Alferez, the Smiling Darling of Camarines Sur, went inside the iconic house of Big Brother.<br /><br />"Gusto ko na mabuhay ng free. 'Yun nga ang sabi ko, Kuya. The secret of happiness is freedom, and the secret of freedom is courage." - Brx Ruiz, August 12, 2024, PBB Gen 11<br /><br />Continuing with the 3rd Nomination Night, Dingdong Bahan-Patrick Ramirez of DongPat (for the second time around), Brx Ruiz, Jas Dudley-Scales, and Noimie Steikunas are also getting at risk of being nominated, still with the presence of double eviction as from the previous one. Brx, in the August 12, 2024 episode, confessed to Kuya that he is a gay, with a same-sex partner in the outside world for ten years. This is his the right time to muster the courage and open up about his true identity inside the Big Brother house.<br /><br />Following the double eviction of Brx and Noimie in the third eviction night, the housemates were shocked off when Big Brother made an announcement that they have committed multiple violations during their stay. They've violated the Big Brother's rules involving the non-usage of lapel microphones, whispering, sign language, disclosing nomination matters, talking about the outside world with guests, sleeping during active hours, and damaging his household items, among others. And with that, he tasked all of them to carry a giant rulebook around the house. The pressure then escalated when Kuya decided that the Housemates with the most violations would face eviction this week, based on the number of nominations.<br /><br />The 4th Nomination Night, which is based on the number of violations (as points), nominated Fyang Smith and Rain Celmar, which lead the pack with 16 violation points each, while Kai Montinola and Kolette Madelo got 14 violation points, DongPat with 13, and Dylan with 11, which one of them will gets evicted inside. This is the edition's most number of nominated housemates of all time - racking up to seven housemates in population (5 regular and 1 duo). And we all know that in the 4th eviction night, DongPat gets evicted. They were later seen in a music video of Rainbow Christmas, sung by Vice Ganda in late-2024.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, for JoliGwen, their journey begins when the Joli, a dentistry graduate, enters inside the house (along with JP Cabrera), a day after Kanata Tapia and Marc Nanninga's eviction, while Gwen Montano, the Brave Bromantiko of Cavite, and also a dentistry graduate, begins his journey on the August 21, 2024 episode. They have relations with Joli and Gwen, that later resulted of being a duo housemate on the following episode after. They were both evicted on the 6th Eviction Night.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the tension is still on in the 5th Nomination Night, wherein Fyang, Jan, and Jas are the nominated housemates to continue their stay inside the Big Brother house and are at risk of eviction, that later evicted the Prodigal Bai from the house. But first, Melai Cantiveros joins in with good vibes as she will be the one to housemates in their current weekly task of producing a Tagalog-Bisaya musical, by showcasing their talents while providing a further knowledge of the Bisaya (Cebuano) culture. Apart from Melai, the 2023 World Hip Hop Dance Champions, Legit Status, and the New Gen Dance Champion Gela Atayde and Coach Vimi Rivera, polished their dance choreography for their weekly task.<br /><br />And oh hey, it's nonchalant! Upon the eviction of Jan Silva, and later nominated Fyang, Kolette, and Joli and Gwen Duo for a fight to stay inside the Big Brother house&mdash;facing imminent eviction for the 6th Nomination Night (and later the Alferez-Montano duo gets out from the Big Brother house), the long-lost biological mother of Kai Montinola made a big reveal, by showing a positive DNA result matching her biological mom, Jean, and eventually meeting her inside the Big Brother house in an emotional encounter. Apart from her adoptive mother Flora, she then expressed her mixed emotions upon getting acquainted with Jean. For her, regardless of now only meeting her biological mother, she is still grateful for the life she has with her adoptive parents while understanding Jean's past actions and wanting to know more about her extended family.<br /><br />The tension of Adults and Teens was happened in PBB Gen 11 for the remainder of weeks. Big Brother asked Jarren and JP through a task to switch bedrooms with Kolette and Jas, prompting the separation of Housemates into two groups, and in the end, Jarren, JP, Fyang, Kai, and Rain teams up for the teens' team, with Kolette, Jas, Binsoy, Dylan, and JM represented the adults' part.<br /><br />He is strictly ordered that the two groups are prohibited from interacting for the remainder of the week, but he later pitted them to a weekly task of stacking a tower of paper cups without using their hands and arms&mdash;further testing their teamwork and competitiveness.<br /><br />Sparks flew inside the Big Brother house when JM confessed his admiration for Jas. JM first revealed that he felt jealous of her being close to Dylan, while Jas noticed why he kept avoiding her. Dylan then cleared the air of having feelings for her while Jas openly said JM has a chance with her. In the 7th nomination round, Dylan, Kolette, and Rain gets nominated and one of them will be in danger of being evicted.<br /><br />Now Jas Dudley-Scales and Fyang Smith are getting in to their nerves as the tension of their controversial rap battle between the two in the middle of the Adults vs. Teens tasks, with people in the online world spreaded hate and bashful comments against not only Jas and Fyang, but also their parents of these housemates, and even the former ones. The rap battle between the two was happened in the September 14, 2024 episode, the same day as the 8th nomination night, that Dylan Yturralde gets evicted from the house. The live broadcast on Kapamilya Online Live also keened it's peak concurrent viewership record of 437,909, an all-time high during the time being. Speaking of Dylan Yturralde, his outside world journey had begun when he was later appeared in an iWant Original Series under the title of Love At First Spike, playing the role of Ethan Villanueva. The series also introduced&nbsp; Emilio Daez, Sean Tristan, and Reign Parani as well, including PBB Gen 11's Rain Celmar and Binsoy Namoca.<br /><br />As they, Jas and Fyang, work towards forgiveness and healing, Big Brother surprised both by bringing in their respective mothers to guide them in restoring their strong bond, following the reconciliation of Jas and Fyang. He also assigned them as the leaders of their new weekly task of assigning both groups to make separate portions of a bridge compatible and connected for the others to cross&mdash;leading towards the reunion between teen and adult Housemates.<br /><br />Because of the issues involving the online hate against the housemates, the former ones, and their respective parents, Pinoy Big Brother had issued a statement that they will be taking legal action who have been perpetrated with these kinds of online posts circulated on social media. PBB did also added that for the 8th and successful eviction votings, that they will only accept votes to save (BBS) on the show's exclusive voting partner, Maya, leaving the vote to evict (BBE) button will be disabled.<br /><br />As for this, they have to transfer two balls one by one from point A to point B, using the pipe. When the ball falls, they have to return to the starting point. The fastest to do it will be saved from the nomination, and this would be their Ligtask challenge for Binsoy, Jas, JM, and Kolette. In the end, Binsoy passed this Ligtask Challenge, with the fastest time of 3 mins. 18 secs., resulting his non-nomination, with JM with 3 mins. 56 secs., Jas with 4 mins. 33 secs., and Kolette with 8 mins. 14 secs. had failed the Ligtask Challenge, resulting their automatic nomination.<br /><br />When Jas ended her journey in the September 21, 2024 episode, it peaked out an another all-time high in peak concurrent viewership - being seen by about 522,850 of Kapamilyas online. As Jas Dudley-Scales gets evicted after garnering the least votes to save with 23.44% (versus Kolette's 40.42% and JM's 36.14%), in the following months, she was appeared on ASAP on Sunday Noontime, being part of the Supahdancers.<br /><br />The concurrent viewership continued to increase every eviction night, as the following week later (September 28, 2024), which saw the eviction of the Fil-Brit Housemate Jarren in the 9th Eviction Night, that Big Brother asked him to stay for a special task of becoming a House Challenger (along withthe ex-housemates, Jas, Dingdong, Patrick, and Therese) that he accepts, it drawn an another all-time high of over 606 thousand. The same thing happened on the 10th eviction night, which saw the exit of Binsoy (citing that he was nominated along with JP, JM, and Rain), as the show continued to post high viewership numbers of over 621 thousand on YouTube alone, via ABS-CBN Entertainment YouTube Channel.<br /><br />After the time when Binsoy gets out, Big Brother made a test about the character and resilience of the remaining Housemates Fyang, JM, JP, Kolette, Rain, and Kai, as they were pitted against his House Challengers, a series of head-to-head challenges, and their hopes of staying inside the house hanging on a balance, that later Big Brother had announced that it was merely for "tetsing purposes" to bring out the best in his Housemates.<br /><br />Big Brother then tasked each Housemate to rank themselves according to the most deserving to be hailed as the next Big Winner. Each of them considered themselves as most deserving, with the exception of Rain, who vouched for her best friend Kai as the PBB Gen 11 Big Winner. And this is what you heard this pair on the internet - KaiRain.<br /><br />Apart from their Big Winner selection, their rankings also showed the least likely to win the competition, with Fyang, JP, and Rain placing in the bottom three. But in a shocking twist, he then revealed that the bottom three Housemates from the majority of their rankings are up for eviction, in which Fyang was also the most voted BBS Vote at the 11th Eviction Night's Final Tally, which is 54.03% vs. Rain's 36.35% and the 11th EN evictee, JP, which got 9.61%.&nbsp;<br /><br />And the search for the Big 4 is over - Fyang Smith, JM Ibarra, Kai Montinola, Kolette Madelo, and Rain Celmar are the remaining housemates of PBB Gen 11 after the exit of JP Cabrera. Viewers, who have Maya app installed, are now having the power to vote for their Big 4 of choice, and interestingly enough, Fyang, Kai, Kolette, and Rain are named as the New Gen Big 4, leaving JM gets evicted for the last time, for receiving 17.32% of BBS Votes with over 786,400 of people are watching the announcement of Big 4 Housemates and the Final Evictee of PBB Gen 11.<br /><br />And on October 26, 2024, the moment that the Kapamilya and Team Online they are waiting for, The Final Stage at the Big Night was happened. The Final Vote Standing for the Big Winner of PBB Gen 11 was the 4th Big Placer, Kai Montinola with 17.38% BBS Votes, followed by the 3rd Big Placer, Kolette Madelo with 25.91% BBS Votes, and the 2nd Big Placer, Rain Celmar with 26.05% votes, making the declaration of the 18th Big Winner of Pinoy Big Brother since it's launch in 2005 was Fyang Smith, voted by 30.66% of people publicly.<br /><br />The Pinoy Big Brother: Gen 11's The Final Stage at the Big Night, got 10.7% of TV Ratings on Nielsen NUTAM Report and had been seen by about 2,267,662 of viewers on Kapamilya Online Live - this is the most highest TV Ratings so far every Saturday night since ABS-CBN Shutdown, and an all-time high in peak concurrent viewers since the launch of Kapamilya Online Live in 2020!

The series promises a unique mix of romance, youthful heartbreak, and the supernatural across its eight episodes. Last May 20, 2025, the announcement of this digiseries broke the news to the online world and the fans of JM and Fyang when they are all set to make their acting debut as a loveteam. It follows a feisty student who escapes to her grandmother&rsquo;s quiet provincial home after being ghosted, only to fall for a mysterious probinsyano who turns out to be a restless soul. What begins as a classic story of moving on transforms into an unforgettable romance that reaches beyond the boundaries of life and death.<br /><br />Directed by Theodore "Ted" Boborol, the man behind &ldquo;Vince &amp; Kath &amp; James&rdquo;, &ldquo;Finally Found Someone&rdquo;, and many more, &ldquo;Ghosting&rdquo; also features Gello Marquez, Vivoree Esclito, Kobie Brown, Zach Guerrero, Peewee O&rsquo;hara, and Ces Quesada. The two short teasers announcing that Ghosting is about to premiere on the streaming platform, were released on two separate dates - the first one was on the day as PBB Collab's Big Night day (just a few minutes before it), July 5, 2025, and the second one was droped in on July 8, 2025, with the full official trailer was shown to the public two days after, July 10, 2025.<br /><br />The teasers and it's trailer, however, featured their soundtrack from the "Forever Fyang" Debut EP Album (produced by Roque "Rox" Santos, the label head of StarPop), "Tayo Hanggang Dulo", wherein as of July 12, 2025 at 20h35, the song was streamed by about 167,817 of people on Spotify, just almost a month after the time when this was released on all online streaming platforms (June 13, 2025). "Tayo Hanggang Dulo" was sung by JM and Fyang themselves, as written by ABS-CBN Music creatives, content, and operations head Jonathan Manalo and Perry Lansigan, for those who have missed it about their album launch.<br /><br />The trailer and teasers have generated excitement and sparked conversations among fans eager to see the tandem of Fyang and JM. In fact, in a recent ABS-CBN Press Release involving this "multuhan" series, its teasers and official trailer racked up over 29 million views across social media and YouTube, ahead of the release of the premiere episode on iWant on the following Saturday, July 19, 2025 (a day before PBB Gen 11's first anniversary). while it reached over 3 million views for the first teaser, and over 9.9 million views for the second one, just after 24 hours from the time when each of the teasers have dropped in online.<br /><br />To promote their upcoming premiere on iWant this July 19, 2025, the casts of Ghosting (JM, Fyang, Vivoree, Kobie, Gello, and Zach) will be seen on ASAP, airing this Sunday, July 13, 2025, on Kapamilya Channel, Kapamilya Online Live, A2Z, and TV5, as well as on it's online part, iWant ASAP, on Kapamilya Online Live and iWant.<br /><br />The supernatural romantic drama, Ghosting, is available for streaming every Saturdays at 20h00 (Philippine Standard Time, UTC+8) beginning July 19, 2025, exclusively to all subscribers of iWant's ad-supported Basic Plan, priced at PHP 35.00 a month. Subscribers of iWant will also gain access to iWant Originals and exclusive content, including the other PBB Gen 11-starred digiseries, "Love At First Spike", starring Dylan Yturralde, Binsoy Namoca, and Rain Celmar.<br /><br />That means beginning July 18, 2025, if you are a fan of PBB Gen 11 of any New Gen Housemates of Big Brother of they want, they can watch Love At First Spike on Fridays, then on the following day, they can also enjoy Ghosting as well, as long as they are subscribed to iWant.<br /><br />Editors Note - UPDATE (July 12, 2025 21h20): Per KPEX, Ghosting's teaser and trailer materials breached over 29-M (previously 23-M).<br /></div>  <h2 class="wsite-content-title">PBB Gen 11: Statement on spliced videos vs. Fyang, concurrent viewers of PBB Collab</h2>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/1/4/5/7/145735993/phcapbbgen11id-2160p-20250626_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph">&#8203;&#8203;As Pinoy Big Brother: Gen 11 is turning one year old in less than two weeks, and fans of JM Ibarra and Fyang Smith are about to get hooked for their upcoming iWant's Original Series, Ghosting, which shall be releasing this July on the Online Streaming Platform, we are aware on a recent issues involving "Spliced Videos" of Gen 11's highly acclaimed Big Winner (Fyang) from a video recording of their "The Unforgettabolabolabol GEN-eral Assembly", held last April 5, 2025 at the SM North EDSA Skydome.<br /><br />In an official statement from Team JMFyang Official on X/Twitter regarding the issues of spliced videos, the admins of the fanbase said that "it is important to address the deliberate use of spliced and misleading video content aimed at misrepresenting Fyang. These manipulated clips have been circulated with the intent to stir division, provoke misunderstanding, and damage reputations."<br /><br />"We urge everyone&mdash;especially our loyal Besties&mdash;to remain committed to truth, context, and kindness in all interactions, both within and outside our fandom. Partial information or out-of-context media can distort reality, and the spread of such content only deepens harm and confusion. The video that has been circulating has been heavily edited to remove crucial context and misrepresent Fyang&rsquo;s words and intent", Team JMFyang Official added.<br /><br />Furthermore, in the official, unedited video that Team JMFyang Official had posted in it's statement (and also shown on their official pages), Fyang said "Alam mo, kahit ilang batch pa yan, walang makakatalo sa batch namin. Hello? Gen 11? Breaking? Highest, Hello? Kaya walang makakatalo sa batch namin kasi lahat kami very genuine, very authentic. Akala nga namin walang nanonood, kaya lahat kami ganon mga ugali namin". That means, PBB Gen 11 remained it's stance in popularity - even it's been a year since the time when our Unforgettabolabolabol Reality Show was broadcast.<br /><br />The DRPS PHCA is deeply concerned on the issues of misinformation and fake news regarding the use of Fyang Smith and it's related portions of the Gen 11 FanCon. When you're in doubt in these concerns, consult to us, any relevant parties involved in this issue. The DRPS PHCA also stands to Protect Fyang Smith at any part, including JM Ibarra, JMFyang's other half.<br /><br />However,&nbsp;In the past few days, we have seen various social media posts circulated online that Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Collab Edition's The Big Night surpassed the numbers from The Final Stage at the Big Night of Pinoy Big Brother: Gen 11, that happened last October 26, 2024, relating to it's Nielsen NUTAM Reports and Peak Concurrent Viewers of their respective season's big night days.<br /><br />For the public who might not know about PBB Gen 11, it is widely known for the 20 New Gen Housemates of Big Brother, especially the edition's New Gen Big 4, Kai Montinola, Kolette Madelo, Rain Celmar, and our one of a kind, yet the Big Winner of the season, Fyang Smith, and it is also a true home behind the highly dominant loveteam of today, JMFyang (JM Ibarra and Fyang Smith), the LGBTQIA+ duo housemates, DongPat (Dingdong Bahan and Patrick Ramirez), and it's continued stance and popularity, through mall shows, TV/Online Show special guestings, music video features, album launches (i.e. JARREN, b luvd, SAYAW, Forever FYANG, and Kaileidoscope), their FanCon show last April 5, 2025 at the SM North EDSA Skydome (dubbed as "The Unforgettabolabolabol GEN-eral Assembly"), and iWant's online shows, i.e. Love At First Spike (with Dylan, Binsoy, and Rain), and Ghosting (with JM and Fyang).<br /><br />Last July 5, 2025, the Big Night for Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Collab Edition, the successor edition of PBB Gen 11 aired on GMA was happened and aired live from the New Frontier Theater, Cubao, Quezon City, that contributed to the proclaimation of it's new Big Winners (the 19th and 20th since PBB's launch in August 21, 2005), Brent Manalo and Mika Salamanca (BreKa).<br /><br />Previously, there are other social media posts circulating online (and including us, as previously posted on our yesterday's Explainer post) that PBB Collab had been voted by 11.0% Nielsen NUTAM Report rating on GMA alone (vs. Tao Po's 1.2%, c. Kapamilya Channel and A2Z, and American Idol's 0.8%, on TV5), while it drawn a Peak Concurrent Viewership of 1,435,183 of people, combining those PCVs of Kapamilya Online Live, iWant, and Kapuso Stream (about 1,036,022 if we base it on KOL only), and it was seen by about 3,150,246 in Peak "Non-Concurrent" Views (this is different from the Peak Concurrent one) on it's Facebook Live Pre-Show (while it drawed a Peak Concurrent Viewership of 133,363 on YouTube).<br /><br />In a recent social media post from GMA Network, the TV Network from where that PBB Collab was broadcast since Day 1 towards the Big Night, it was said that it have been voted by 10.5%, still on GMA Network alone. PBB Gen 11's Big Night, dubbed as "The Final Stage", that happened last October 26, 2024, was voted by 10.7% of People (Nielsen NUTAM Report, c. Kapamilya Channel, A2Z, and TV5), and it is still considered the highest rating PBB Big Night Edition among all other editions of Pinoy Big Brother in the decade of 2020s (i.e. Connect, Kumunity Season 10, Gen 11, and Collab, refer to Appendix).<br /><br />In conclusion, Pinoy Big Brother: Gen 11 will remain it's stance of being unbeatened with any other edition of PBB, especially in relation to the Big Night days. PBB Gen 11's The Final Stage at the Big Night got 10.7% of TV Ratings on Nielsen NUTAM Report and had been seen by about 2,267,662 of viewers on Kapamilya Online Live, when compared to PBB Collab's Big Night numbers of 10.5% of TV Ratings and about 1,435,183 in combined Peak Concurrent Viewers (including 1,036,022 on Kapamilya Online Live).<br /><br />Whenever you are a fan of JM Ibarra, Fyang Smith, Kai Montinola, Jarren Garcia, Rain Celmar, Kolette Madelo, Jas Dudley-Scales, Dylan Yturralde, Dingdong Bahan and Patrick Ramirez of DongPat, Binsoy Namoca, Kanata Tapia, Marc Nanninga, Brx Ruiz, Noimie Steikunas, Joli Alferez and Gwen Montano of Joli and Gwen, Jan Silva, JP Cabrera, and Therese Villamor, Pinoy Big Brother: Gen 11 remains its continued stance of the Filipino people, with the housemates future projects we're about to see very soon, i.e. JMFyang in Ghosting on iWant, and Shake, Rattle, and Roll: Evil Origins (the recently-announced 51st Metro Manila Film Festival Official Entry Film), in Philippine Cinemas this December 25, 2025.&#8203;<br />&#8203;<br />And that is what our official slogan stands for in Pinoy Big Brother: Gen 11 - "Aba Ayos ang ating mga Unforgettabolabolabol New Gen Housemates ni Kuya", for almost a year since it's premiere last July 20, 2024.</div>  <h2 class="wsite-content-title">PBB Collab: ICYMI, the Big Winner of PBB Collab was BreKa</h2>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/1/4/5/7/145735993/pbbcollabblog-pbbcollabbignightonlineviewership-20250707_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph">&#8203;&ldquo;Hindi po sapat ang mga salitang &lsquo;masaya,&rsquo; &lsquo;mahal ko kayo,&rsquo; at &lsquo;salamat po&rsquo; para ipaliwanag ang nararamdaman ko ngayon.

This data was gathered within the period from June 16 to 20, 2025 for the TV Ad Loads and Concurrent Viewership, and within the period of June 16 to 19, 2025 for the TV Ratings, via Nielsen NUTAM Report.<br /><br />For the number of TV Ads, on our first day of the countings between Sang'gre and FPJ's Batang Quiapo last June 16, 2025, the DRPS PHCA TV Ad Listings had counted about 36 TV Commercials on GMA for Sang'gre (where the first gap had aired 9 TV Ads, then the second gap had 10, the third gap had 9, and the fourth and final gap had 8), when compared with FPJ's Batang Quiapo, where it aired 113 TV Ads on Kapamilya Channel, 82 TV Ads on A2Z, and 85&nbsp; TV Ads on TV5 (39+36+37 on KapCha, 29+26+27 on A2Z, and 30+27+28 on TV5).<br /><br />On the remaining weeks of our countings, for Sang'gre on GMA, among all of the four commercial gaps that we have counted through our DRPS PHCA TV Ad Listings, the June 17, 2025 episode aired 24 TV Ads, then on June 18, 2025 episode, it had 28, the June 19, 2025 episode aired 25 TV Ads, and on June 20, 2025, it aired 28 TV Ads.

"the board") shall order a reclassification once after screening was made, if necessary. The passage of this senate bill, made the board to regulate streaming contents to "address issues of obscenity, immorality, and senseless violence in the digital platforms", in a press message from the Senate.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Directors Guild of the Philippines (DGPI), in its statement last June 4, 2025, strongly opposed the Senate Bill, over the extension of censorship jurisdiction into VOD services, because it would further destroy the rights of it's content creators' rights to free expression and viewers' rights to free access to expression, as well as it could infringe the industry in local films, while there is no need to create this "redundant" new law like the SB No. 2805.<br /><br />Additionally, AKTOR, monikered as the "League of Filipino Actors", followed suit in the sole responsibility to let the congress halt the said senate bill, and to initiate a meaningful, inclusive dialogue with the creative industry, according to their recent statement. "We believe in a self-regulating industry, where accountability is upheld from within, and reforms are made in genuine partnership with the community", AKTOR said in it's statement.<br /><br />"We urge our legistlators to bring the industry to the table and begin again, so that any regulatory framework truly protects, not policies,the creative space,", AKTOR added.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>  <h2 class="wsite-content-title">&#8203;Thanks for reading our weekly newsletter!&#8203;</h2>  <div class="paragraph"><span>This is the end of our weekly newsletter from DRPS PHCA Free.

However, in an unrelated manner, when the Awards Night of the 6th Village Pipol Choice Awards (VPCA) was held last May 29, 2025, Esnyr was named as the YouTuber of the Year, and it was received on behalf of him, since during that time, he's currently inside the Big Brother House while persuing his safety from nomination and being the medalist of the 2nd Big Intensity Challenge, besides the Kapuso housemate, AZ.<br /><br />Based on the Tally of Votes for the Kapuso Housemates, aside from the now-evicted Vince Maristela, Charlie Fleming with 10.35% BBS Votes, Mika Salamanca with 22.10% Votes, Dustin Yu with 25.20% Votes, and Will Ashley with 33.09% Votes will continue their persuing of taking part of the Final Duos towards the Big Night. Charlie, in which she returned the Big Brother house upon the reception of the highest BBS Votes from the wildcard, will also continue her journey inside the house for even longer, unlike in the 2nd Eviction Night, wherein she, along with the other half of the ChaKira Duo, Kira Balinger, was evicted inside the house.<br /><br />Besides Xyriel Manabat that have been evicted, and also based on the Tally of Votes for the other safe Kapamilya Housemates, will also remain their continuation of their journey inside the house as well, because River Joseph received 13.83% BBS Votes, whereas Klarisse de Guzman also received 19.58% Votes, including Bianca de Vera's 30.49% BBS Votes, and Brent Manalo's 32.05% BBS Votes. More twists will about to come on Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Collab Edition, only here on GMA, Kapuso Stream, and Kapamilya Online Live.</div>  <h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:left;">PBB Gen 11: Kolette and Rain, are seen in a music video, also with their Album Launches + More</h2>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/1/4/5/7/145735993/phcapbbgen11-housemateupdates-20250530_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph">At a stroke of midnight of May 30, 2025, ABS-CBN Star Music released all of the five (5) tracks of Rain Celmar's own album, under the title, "b luvd", on all streaming platforms, including Spotify and Apple Music.

The fastest Kapuso and Kapamilya housemate who made it the fastest will be named as the Final Duo and will be safe from nomination.<br /><br />And therefore, as what Big Brother has announced during the May 23 and 24, 2025 episodes, Shuvee Entrata was the fastest among all of the Kapuso housemates, as she have answered all of the six questions correctly in just six minutes and five seconds, when compared to Will Ashley's 11m 0s, Dustin Yu's 14m 20s, Mika Salamanca's 20m 46s, and Vince Maristela's 29m 40s. Unfortunately, Charlie Fleming, one of the Kapuso housemate who have returned inside the house from the wildcard votings, along with AZ Martinez decided to do not continue their 1st BIC Task, and therefore they Did Not Finish the given challenge.<br /><br />For the Kapamilya Side, Ralph de Leon, who is also among of the Kapamilya ex-housemates that turned official, returning housemates, also from the wildcard votings, also made the fastest among all of the other Star Magic Artists-Housemates, as he made the 1st BIC Task correctly in just 4m 43s - versus Xyriel Manabat's 6m 9s, Brent Manalo's 6m 12s, Klarisse de Guzman's 6m 31s, and Esnyr Ranollo's 8m 48s, along with the other Kapamilya housemates who didn't finish the task entirely, namely Bianca de Vera and River Joseph.<br /><br />As for this, Shuvee and Ralph will not be nominated for the upcoming nomination night and will be excluded from taking part the 2nd and Final Big Intensity Challenge Task, whereas the other housemates who did not win in the 1st BIC Task, will have the chance to get a medal to become immune and be part of the final duo through the 2nd part of the challenge. If they win, they (one Kapamilya and one Kapuso housemate, as implied in the mechanics of the BICT of PBB Collab) will get a Final Duo medal and being safe from nomination, whereas for those who didn't win in the 2nd BICT, they will be automatically nominated for eviction - and the votings now done individually, as what the recent episode has announced in here.<br /><br />Who among of the remaining, non-winning housemates from the 1st Big Intensity Challenge will receive a final duo medal in the 2nd BIC Task?

Thus, Shuvee, along with Bianca, gets nominated.<br /><br />Along with that, XyDust, in which they've got 6 points and JoRa, that had 9 points, gets nominated as well.

Other duos, such as BreTin (4 pts), WiKla (2 pts.), and JoshNyr (no points), are safe from nomination, while MiBi and ViLio are immune, citing that for MiBi, they accomplished the Big Brother's Immunity Task, and for ViLio, had entered the house a week prior.<br /><br />On the 2nd Eviction Night, MicVer and RAZ will continue to persue their journey inside the PBB Collab House for even longer (while River Joseph, along with it's co-housemate, Emilio Daez, will take part of the casts of an upcoming iWantTFC Series called "Love At First Spike", along with PBB Gen 11's Binsoy Namoca, Dylan Yturralde, and Rain Celmar, and among others) - that's because they've received a BBS Vote (on the Maya app) of 32.77% and 37.24% respectively. This means, ChaKira, with the lowest BBS votes as previously mentioned in here, has ended their journey, after more than a month since their entry inside the house.<br /><br />Furthermore, there will be a new duo to enter inside the Big Brother house. Who are they? Let's find out this Sunday, April 13, 2025, on Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Collab Edition. Moreover, this program will not be broadcast on-air between April 17 and 19, 2025, due to the observance of the Holy Week.

In an unexpected event, Marco Adobas of Pangkat Alon violated a rule stated in his signed agreement, as a reason for him to be disqualified, and will not continue in the competition.<br /><br />And because of the serious allegations he made on his social media accounts involving the competition and the program, there is a possibility that he will be charged, and as a result of this happening, the program decided to replace Marco with Arvery Lagoring (from the disbanded group, Pangkat Amihan), so that the number of members of the group, from where Marco was taking part of, remains complete.<br /><br />Thus, Marco Adobas will be disqualified from taking part of this edition of that competition and will no longer part of the Pangkat Alon, and it will be replaced with Arvery Lagoring, taking part of the same group as Marco's.</div>  <h2 class="wsite-content-title">Thanks for reading our weekly newsletter!&#8203;</h2>  <div class="paragraph"><span>This is the end of our weekly newsletter from DRPS PHCA Free.
